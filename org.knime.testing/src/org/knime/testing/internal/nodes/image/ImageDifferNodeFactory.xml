                Used in regression tests to test the created image with a reference image. The node will compare
                (depending on the dialog settings) the incoming images during execute and
                fails with an exception if they are not equal (or do not meet
                the expectations). In that case the node stays not executed and the
                test will fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the node's dialog, you can adjust how individual the images are compared. The default is to check for
                exact equality. For certain images you can relax the comparison by using special checkers, e.g. by
                specifying a certain allowed percentage of difference.
