/**
 * Collects stack traces and writes them into a file. It launches two thread (in
 * its constructor) that periodically create snapshots of the stacks of all
 * threads and continuously write those snapshots into a file (specified as an
 * argument to the constructor). <br>
 * This goes together with the {@link StackDumpAnalyzer} class which uses the
 * file written out by this class and creates an HTML result file from it.<br>
 * The collecting and analyzing of stack traces of course only gives you a rough
 * idea of where time is spent in the code. But it is very easy to use and comes
 * with only a small performance hit. Sometimes it is good enough to find where
 * the bottleneck sits.<p>
 * How to use this:<br>
 * Instantiate this class, providing a file name (in which the stack traces are
 * written into) and an interval (in milli seconds). After that stack traces
 * are collected after each interval and written to file (in two independent
 * threads). If you wish to stop stack dumping, call stopDumping() on this
 * instance. Use the {@link StackDumpAnalyzer} to analyze the output file (or
 * its main method).
