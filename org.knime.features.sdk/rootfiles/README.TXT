KNIME SDK
============================================================

Quickstart guide:
- Extract the archive (if you read this here, you likely already did so).
- Launch eclipse/eclipse.exe to start the Eclipse IDE, select a workspace
  directory in the workspace prompt and continue from there.

How to get additional features:
  KNIME allows for an easy integration of new features. These often 
  come under a different license and therefore are not included in 
  this archive. For example an R integration feature 
  (http://www.r-project.org) and a chemistry feature (using the chemistry
  development kit, CDK, http://cdk.sf.net/) are available. These features
  are installed via the KNIME update site. In Eclipse select 
  "Help", "Install New Software...". The Update Dialog opens; Select the 
  tab "Available Software" and select the features you want to install.
  (In case the KNIME update site doesn't show, click "Available Software Sites..."
  and enable or add KNIME's update site.) 
  You need to restart Eclipse after installing new extensions in order 
  to get them activated.
  
  Note, the update site is also available as zip archive for a later offline
  installation. Refer to the knime.org website for details.
