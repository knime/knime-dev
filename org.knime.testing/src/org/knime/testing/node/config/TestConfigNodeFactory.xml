    <shortDescription>
        Configures a workflow test.
	</shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node holds settings for the workflow test. It replaces the
            config files that have been used previously.
            <br />
            The execution of the node does nothing, only the settings entered
            in the dialog will be read later-on by the
            testing framework.
        </intro>

        <tab name="Workflow settings">
            <option name="Owner's mail address">
                Enter the e-mail address of the workflow owner here. A mail will be sent
                to this address
                if the workflow test fails. You can enter multiple addresses
                by separating them with commas.
            </option>
            <option name="Log Errors, Warnings, Infos">
                These lists contains error, warning, or info messages that must be present
                in the log
                file after the workflows has been fully executed. Usually these
                are messages written by a NodeLogger.

        <tab name="Node settings">
            <option name="Node must fail">
                If the node selected in the list above must fail for a successful test,
                check this
                option.

            <option name="Required error message">
                Enter the error message on the node selected above that must be
                present after the workflow has been fully executed. If it is not
                present the test fails.<br />
                This field is pre-filled with the current error message of the
                selected node (if there is any), indicated by the gray text color.
                If you want to really use this message click in the text field,
                and possibly edit it. Once the text color is black, the message
                is used.
