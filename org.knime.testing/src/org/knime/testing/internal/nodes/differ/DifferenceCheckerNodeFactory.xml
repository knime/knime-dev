            <p>
                Used in regression tests to test the created data table with a
                reference data table. The node will compare
                (depending
                on the dialog settings) the incoming tables during execute and
                fails with an exception if the
                tables are not equal (or do not meet
                the expectations). In that case the node stays not executed and the
                test will fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the node's dialog, you can adjust how individual columns are compared. The default is to check for
                exact equality. For certain column types you can relax the comparison by using special checkers.
                Examples
                are numeric column where you may want to use an epsilon or string columns where you may want to
                ignore
                different line feed characters (Windows vs. Unix). The special checkers are used for the cell contents
                as well as for the column domain (i.e. possible values and bounds).
            </p>
            <p>In order to configure column, change the checker in the second column and if applicable configure
                it in
                the panel below the column table.
