	<shortDescription>
		Compares the two input tables.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
			Used in regression tests to test the created data table with a 
			previously stored golden data table. The node will compare (depending
			on the dialog settings) the incoming tables during execute and 
			fails with an exception if the tables are not equal (or do not meet
			the expectations). In that case the node stays not executed and the 
			test will fail.</p>
			<p>
			In the node's dialog, select the criteria that should be used to 
			compare the two input tables:</p>
		</intro>
		<option name="TableDiffer">The node succeeds if the two input tables are
		        equal. Each data cell of each row is compared with the corresponding
		        cell of the other table using the 
		        <tt>DataCell.equalsDataCell()</tt> method.
		</option>		
		<option name="NegativeDiffer">A useless and not working option. To be 
				removed soon!
		</option>		
		<option name="LearnerScoreComperator">Compares two tables from a Scorer
		        node. Can be used to ensure the classification error of a 
		        learner/predictor is within a certain range. The predecessor
		        must be a scorer, the golden table should also be generated
		        by a scorer (probably by the same in a previous run). This option
		        allows specifying the upper and lower tolerance (in percent) for 
		        the scorer result. The node succeeds, if the classification error
		        of the current result is not worse than the golden error minus
		        the lower tolerance and not better that the golden classification error plus
		        the upper tolerance.
